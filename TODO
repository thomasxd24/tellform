1. Add background image in forms
- Submit-form.client.controller.js:10 is the place to look
- Need to change mongoose model (form.server.model.js) ~ design.backgroundImage
- Need to add option in settings (admin-form.client.view.html:127)
2. make multiple logic jumps
3. add GET query fillable
4. (pretty much close to 3.) make variables on the form, it must be addable on the form editor
5. make POST request once the form is submitted.
6. think of how to handle spaces on GET queries
7. Uses values of the form to fill in labels
8. Add currency options field at form editor
9. don't display next questions until arrived. (This has to do with logic jumps)
10. add image for multiple choices
